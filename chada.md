Tell the world about the beautiful faces
Tell the world about your happy smile
Tell the world about the hills and mountains
Tell the world about this brand new style

'Coz the world is full of wonder
And the world is full of fun
Tell the world about the Father
Tell the world about the Son
'Coz He loves you and He loves me
Tell the world about His power and majesty
